# Programs and Scripts

# processingGraph.cpp

Read stats.txt files from gem5 and process the data, output to a .jgr file

# arrayflip.c

Input the size of a big array, then the program will go through randomly and flip bits

# Debug scripts

gdb script ran with

```
source -v <script name>
```

The bash script is used during a gdb debug session

The -x flag of gdb is also used to run a script before the program starts running and is just like doing “source” in the gdb command line
