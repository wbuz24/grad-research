Notes for Tanmay 

 - 'contents' slide title sould be more specific
 - slide numbers always
 - bring water to take breaks from speaking
 - be consistent & specific with your terminology, don't be afraid to be technical
 - enlarge text when you can - make everything as readable as possible
 - I like the way you fill whitespace with figures

Search-based
 - Dijkstra's is not "not aggressive enough", instead it is too aggressive (O(n^2)), A* improves the search by informing the optimal direction 
 - What is the state-of-the-art & why is that not your route of exploration?

Learning-based
 - Similar as before, less of a list and more targeted to downsides / reasons this is not what you are investigating/presenting

 - Your story is about sampling-based Motion planning, set up search & learning-based approaches to support your inevitable point with sampling-based

Sampling-based
 - more main points on slides instead of lists 
 - if you are going to show code, point very specifically to a line(s) that you want to focus, but if you can make your point without code, you should
 - change "point x" to a target list of components that your algorithm addresses

FPGAs
 - "kernels" slides should have larger, black text  
 - immediate change in tone and confidence

Noise Generation
 - great introduction to why it is useful, but what it lacks / needs improvement (gave idea of what you are targeting in less than 5 seconds) 

Results
 - Keep color schemes consistent
 - what are the percentage bars
 - Better timing with the FPGA because of customization opposed to GPUs
